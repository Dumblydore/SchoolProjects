Intro: Web and HTML - Assignment 1, First Page
-----------------------------------------------
Create a decent-looking homepage for yourself in your people.emich.edu account.  Use at least one of each of the basic HTML tags: html, head, body, title, p, h1 - h6, ul, ol, li, img, a.

The page should contain a link on the string "Computer Science Department" to the Computer Science Dept. web page: http://www.emich.edu/compsci/

Your page should say a few things about yourself.  E.g., hobbies, favorite music, etc.  The page must include at least one jpeg image, which you should be able to find on the internet.

The page must include a table with row header of three values, "red", "green", "blue", and a column header of the same three values. The nine elements in the body of the table should be the colors that result from mixing the row and column colors of each.

Submit to the drop box your .html file, as well as the image file.  Alternatively, you may install the files on a web server (such as people.emich.edu), and submit to the drop box a document containing the URL for your site.
